            <h4>Fed up with being sidelined by swimmer’s shoulder? Here’s your ultimate guide to fixing and preventing shoulder injuries from swimming.</h4><br></br>
            <h4>In this guide to swimmer’s shoulder, we are going to look closely at the most common injury swimmers experience in the water</h4>.<br></br>
            <h4>More specifically, we are going to look at:</h4><br></br>
            <h4> - Just how often swimmer’s shoulder happens</h4>
            <h4> - The more common causes of swimmer’s shoulders</h4>
            <h4> - Tips on how you can train around injured shoulders</h4><br></br>
            <h4>And some actionable tips for helping fix and prevent swimmer’s shoulder.</h4>
            <h4>Let’s dive right in.</h4><br></br>
            
            <h2>How Common is Swimmer’s Shoulder?</h2>
            <h4>If you’ve invested even a moderate amount of time training up and down and around the black line you have become intimately familiar with the term ‘swimmer’s shoulder.’</h4><br></br>
            <h4>Given that swimmers annually perform hundreds of thousands of arm rotations it should be of little shock to learn that this type of work and frequency places a lot stress on the shoulder musculature and joint.</h4><br></br>
            <h4>As a result, the shoulders are the most commonly injured body part as a result of competitive swimming.</h4><br></br>
            <h4>Studies have shown a large number of swimmers will experience injury to their shoulders over the course of their swimming careers:</h4>
            <br></br>
            <h4>- One study showed 47% of collegiate swimmers having experienced shoulder pain that lasted 3 weeks or longer (with the same study reporting 48% of masters swimmers experiencing it as well despite half the workouts of the collegiate swimmers).</h4>
            <br></br>
            <h4>- A study of over 1,200 American club swimmers found swimmers presently experiencing shoulder pain ranging between 10% in the younger age groups, and 26% of national team swimmers experiencing pain at the time they were surveyed. Using a kick-board and swim paddles were also reported to aggravate shoulder pain.</h4>
            <br></br>
            <h4>- Another study done in Australia on 80 of their elite swimmers aged 13-25 found that 91% of them were experiencing shoulder pain. When given an MRI, 69% of the swimmers showed inflammation of the tendon of the supraspinatus muscle. (This bad boy helps to keep your shoulder stable and helps lift the arm sideways—which is why when you have tendonitis in this spot that it hurts when you recover the arm.)</h4>
            <br></br>
            <h4>- And lastly, when the University of Iowa’s men’s and women’s swim team was tracked and monitored for a period of five years the shoulder was the most reported injured body part, followed by the neck/back. Freshmen, in particular, tended to suffer injury more often—sometimes twice as frequently—than their teammates.</h4>
            <br></br>
            <h4>These studies and stats tell us what most swimmers and those around the sport already intuitively know—that swimmer’s shoulder is frighteningly common.</h4>
